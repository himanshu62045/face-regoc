Face Recognition System
This project implements a real-time eye blink detection and alert system using OpenCV, face_recognition, and Google Colab's camera interface. It can help monitor drowsiness by analyzing eye aspect ratio (EAR) and triggering an alert when the EAR falls below a certain threshold for a specified number of consecutive frames.

Features
Eye Aspect Ratio Calculation: Measures the eye aspect ratio using landmarks of the eyes to detect if the eyes are closed.
Drowsiness Alert: Triggers an alert if the eyes are closed for a certain number of frames.
Real-Time Video Capture: Captures video in real-time using a webcam and processes each frame to detect facial landmarks and eye closure.
Custom Thresholds: Adjustable minimum EAR and frame thresholds for fine-tuning the system's sensitivity.
Google Colab Integration: Utilizes Google Colab's ability to capture images from the webcam in a browser-based environment.
Requirements
To run this project, ensure the following libraries are installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Scipy
face_recognition
Google Colab Patches (cv2_imshow)
IPython
You can install the dependencies using the following:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy scipy face_recognition google-colab ipython
How It Works
Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR): The EAR is calculated using the Euclidean distance between the vertical eye landmarks divided by the horizontal eye distance. When the eyes are closed, the EAR decreases significantly.

Alert Mechanism: If the EAR is below a predefined threshold (min_aer) for a specific number of consecutive frames (eye_ar_cosec_frames), an alert is triggered (in this case, a text message in the console).

Image Capture in Google Colab: The system uses JavaScript to capture frames via webcam in Google Colab and processes each frame for facial landmarks.

Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repo_url>
cd eye-blink-detection
Run the Script: Open the project in Google Colab, and run the Python script in the notebook.

Adjust Parameters:

min_aer: Minimum EAR threshold (default 0.30)
eye_ar_cosec_frames: Number of consecutive frames with EAR below threshold to trigger the alert (default 10)
Stopping the Script: Press q to stop the script.

Example Code
python
Copy code
min_aer = 0.30
eye_ar_cosec_frames = 10
Future Enhancements


How to run
To run the project, follow these steps:

Get the code: Clone the project repository from GitHub using git clone https://github.com/himanshu62045/face-regoc.git.
Install dependencies: Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt. This will install all the necessary libraries and packages required to run the project.
Run the project: Run the project by executing python main.py. This will start the facial recognition system, which will detect and identify faces in images.
What's inside
The project consists of the following files:

face_detection.py: This file contains the code for detecting faces in images. It uses OpenCV to load the image, convert it to grayscale, and then apply face detection algorithms to locate faces.
face_recognition.py: This file contains the code for recognizing faces in images. It uses the face_recognition library to compare the detected faces against a database of known faces and identify the individuals.
main.py: This file contains the code for running the entire facial recognition system. It imports the necessary functions from face_detection.py and face_recognition.py and uses them to detect and recognize faces in images.
Note: Make sure you have a webcam or camera connected to your computer before running the project. Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the camera. Additionally, you may need to adjust the camera settings and lighting conditions to optimize the performance of the facial recognition system.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while running the project, check the following:

Make sure you have installed all the required dependencies.
Check that your webcam or camera is properly connected and configured.
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the camera.
Adjust the camera settings and lighting conditions to optimize the performance of the facial recognition system.


Future Development
This project is still in its early stages, and there are many ways to improve and expand it. Some potential areas for future development include:

Improving accuracy: The facial recognition system can be improved by using more advanced algorithms and techniques, such as deep learning-based approaches.
Increasing efficiency: The system can be optimized to run faster and more efficiently, making it suitable for real-time applications.
Adding more features: The system can be expanded to include additional features, such as emotion detection, age estimation, and facial expression analysis.
Add sound alerts for better real-time feedback.Improve accuracy with more advanced facial recognition models.Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
